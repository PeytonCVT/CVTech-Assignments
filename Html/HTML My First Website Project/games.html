<img src="./images/roblox.jfif" width=500 alt="Roblox">
<p style="width:50%">Roblox is one of my favorite websites to play on due to it's limitless amount of games for singleplayer and multiplayer. Roblox has so many different games with different types of genre to the point where it's hard to be bored while playing.</p>

<!-- Lethal Company -->
<br>
<br>
<img src="./images/lethal.jfif" width=500 alt="Lethal">
<p style="width:50%">LETHAL COMPANY, absolutely a 10/10 game I couldn't say any less about it. The game is amazing to play with friends or by yourself with all of the horrifiying monsters inside. The game is an absolute blast and it's super easy to mod and change the files to change your experience even more.</p>

<img src="./images/GOW.jfif" width=500 alt="GOW">
<p style="width:50%">God of War Ragnarok is a game about running around and chasin after this dude that took your son, I mean I'd be pissed too if my son went to the enemies side without letting me know. Anyways the game is great and I would say a solid 8/10.</p>

<img src="./images/hollow.jfif" width=500 alt="Hollow">
<p style="width:50%">Hollow knight is one of my favorite 2D games I've played. This game is a rpg like game where you run around kill bosses and gather new loot, I would honestly say the game is around a 7/10 very good but very long.</p>
